=========================INNER JOINS===================
we have only selected columns from a single table. but in real world we often select columns from multiple tables.
in orders table we have a column called customer_id. this actually contains the identity of a customer who has placed the order. we are not storing the full customers addres in it. 

in SQL there are two types of JOINs
1- inner JOIN
2- outer JOIN

in INNER JOIN the INNER keyword is actually optional. 

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
        ON condition(orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id)

-> selecting only orderid, firstname, lastname, customerid

SELECT order_id, orders.customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id

// here we are repeating the words like orders, customers
// alias their names

SELECT order_id, o.customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

=== -> -> Exercise
Join tho order_items table with product table such that each table shows the product_id as well as its name followed by the quantity and unit price from the order_items table

SELECT  order_id, p.product_id, name, quantity, oi.unit_price
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p 
	ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
